::

Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for the
air-side heat transfer of heat exchangers with flat tubes and several
fin geometries.

Fuctions kc_flatTube and kc_flatTube_KC

There are basically three differences:

-   The function kc_flatTube is using kc_flatTube_KC but offers
    additional output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt
    number and failure status (an output of 1 means that the function is
    not valid for the inputs).
-   Generally the function kc_flatTube_KC is numerically best used for
    the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc
    at known mass flow rate.
-   You can perform an inverse calculation from kc_flatTube_KC, where an
    unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean convective
    heat transfer coefficient kc

Restriction

-   According to the kind of fin geometry the calculation is valid in a
    range of Re from 100 to 5000.
-   medium = air

Geometry

Calculation

The mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for heat exchanger is
calculated through the corresponding Coulburn factor j:

    j = f(geometry, Re)

with the resulting mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc

    kc =  j * Re_L_p * Pr^(1/3) * lambda / L_p (Louver fin)

or

    kc =  j * Re_D_h * Pr^(1/3) * lambda / D_h (Rectangular offset strip fin)

Verification

transfer coefficient kc is shown below for different fin geometries at
similar dimensions.
