Information
===========

::

Package Modelica® is a standardized and free package that is developed
together with the Modelica® language from the Modelica Association, see
http://www.Modelica.org. It is also called Modelica Standard Library. It
provides model components in many domains that are based on standardized
interface definitions. Some typical examples are shown in the next
figure:

For an introduction, have especially a look at:

-   Overview provides an overview of the Modelica Standard Library
    inside the User's Guide.
-   Release Notes summarizes the changes of new versions of this
    package.
-   Contact lists the contributors of the Modelica Standard Library.
-   The Examples packages in the various libraries, demonstrate how to
    use the components of the corresponding sublibrary.

This version of the Modelica Standard Library consists of

-   1280 models and blocks, and
-   910 functions

that are directly usable (= number of public, non-partial classes).
