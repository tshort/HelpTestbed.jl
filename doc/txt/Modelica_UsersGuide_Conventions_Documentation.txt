================================================================

::

General

1.  In the HTML documentation of any Modelica library, the headings
    <h1>, <h2> and <h3> should not be used, because they are utilized by
    the automatically generated documentation.
2.  The utilized heading format starts with <h4> and terminates with
    </h4>, e.g., <h4>Description</h4>
3.  The <h4> and <h5> headings must not be terminated by a colon (:).
4.  For additional structuring <h5> and </h5> may be used as
    demonstrated below.

Structure

The following parts should be added to the documentation of each
component:

1.  General information without additional subsection explains how the
    class works
2.  Syntax (for functions only): shows syntax of function call with
    minimum and full input parameters
3.  Implementation (optional): explains how the implementation is made
4.  Limitations (optional): explains the limitations of the component
5.  Notes (optional): if required/useful
6.  Examples (optional): if required/useful
7.  Acknowledgments (optional): if required
8.  See also: shows hyperlinks to related models
9.  Revision history (optional): if required/intended for a
    package/model, the revision history should be placed in
    annotation(Documentation(revisions="..."));

These sections should appear in the listed order. The only exceptions
are hierachically structured notes and examples as explained in the
following.

Additional notes and examples

Some additional notes or examples may require additional <h5> headings.
For either notes or examples the following cases may be applied:

Example 1

This is an example of a single note.

    <h5>Note</h5>
    <p>This is the note.</p>

Example 2

This is an example of a very simple structure.

    <h5>Notes</h5>
    <p>This is the first note.</p>
    <p>This is the second note.</p>

Example 3

This example shows a more complex structure with enumeration.

    <h5>Note 1</h5>
    ...
    <h5>Note 2</h5>
    ...

Automatically created documentation

For parameters, connectors, as well as inputs and outputs of function
automatic documentation is generated by the tool from the quoted
comments.
