Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes: Modelica.Magnetic.FluxTubes



Library for modelling of electromagnetic devices with lumped magnetic
networks

Information
===========

::

This library contains components for modelling of electromagnetic
devices with lumped magnetic networks. Those models are suited for both
rough design of the magnetic subsystem of a device as well as for
efficient dynamic simulation at system level together with neighbouring
subsystems. At present, components and examples for modelling of
translatory electromagnetic and electrodynamic actuators are provided.
If needed, these components can be adapted to network modelling of
rotational electrical machines.

User's Guide gives a short introduction to the underlying concept of
magnetic flux tubes, summarizes the calculation of magnetic reluctance
forces from lumped magnetic network models and lists reference
literature.

Examples illustrates the usage of magnetic network models with simple
models from different fields of application.
