::

Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for a
helical pipe in the laminar flow regime.

Functions kc_laminar and kc_laminar_KC

There are basically three differences:

-   The function kc_laminar is using kc_laminar_KC but offers additional
    output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt number and
    failure status (an output of 1 means that the function is not valid
    for the inputs).
-   Generally the function kc_laminar_KC is numerically best used for
    the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc
    at known mass flow rate.
-   You can perform an inverse calculation from kc_laminar_KC, where an
    unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean convective
    heat transfer coefficient kc

Restriction

-   laminar regime (Reynolds number ≤ critical Reynolds number Re_crit)
-   neglect influence of heat transfer direction (heating/cooling)
    according to Sieder and Tate

The critical Reynolds number Re_crit in a helical pipe depends on its
mean curvature diameter d_coil. The smaller the mean curvature diameter
of the helical pipe, the earlier the turbulent regime will start due to
vortexes out of higher centrifugal forces.

Geometry

Calculation

The mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for helical pipes is
calculated through the corresponding Nusselt number Nu according to [VDI
2002, p. Gc 2, eq. 5] :

    Nu = 3.66 + 0.08*[1 + 0.8*(d_hyd/d_coil)^0.9]*Re^m*Pr^(1/3)

with the exponent m for the Reynolds number

    m = 0.5 + 0.2903*(d_hyd/d_coil)^0.194

and the resulting mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc

    kc =  Nu * lambda / d_hyd

with

  ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------
  d_mean                    as mean diameter of helical pipe [m],

  d_coil = f(geometry)      as mean curvature diameter of helical pipe
                            [m],

  d_hyd                     as hydraulic diameter of the helical pipe [m],

  h                         as slope of helical pipe [m],

  kc                        as mean convective heat transfer coefficient
                            [W/(m2K)],

  lambda                    as heat conductivity of fluid [W/(mK)],

  L                         as total length of helical pipe [m],

  Nu = kc*d_hyd/lambda      as mean Nusselt number [-],

  Pr = eta*cp/lambda        as Prandtl number [-],

  Re = rho*v*d_hyd/eta      as Reynolds number [-],

  Re_crit = f(geometry)     as critical Reynolds number [-].
  ------------------------- ----------------------------------------------

Verification

The mean Nusselt number Nu representing the mean convective heat
transfer coefficient kc is shown below for different numbers of turns
n_nt at constant total length of the helical pipe.

The convective heat transfer of a helical pipe is enhanced compared to a
straight pipe due to occurring turbulences resulting out of centrifugal
forces. The higher the number of turns, the better is the convective
heat transfer for the same length of a pipe.

Note that the ratio of hydraulic diameter to total length of helical
pipe d_hyd/L has no remarkable influence on the coefficient of heat
transfer kc.

=====================================================================================================

::

Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc of a
helical pipe in a hydrodynamically developed laminar and turbulent flow
regime.

Functions kc_overall and kc_overall_KC

There are basically three differences:

-   The function kc_overall is using kc_overall_KC but offers additional
    output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt number and
    failure status (an output of 1 means that the function is not valid
    for the inputs).
-   Generally the function kc_overall_KC is numerically best used for
    the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc
    at known mass flow rate.
-   You can perform an inverse calculation from kc_overall_KC, where an
    unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean convective
    heat transfer coefficient kc

Geometry and Calculation

This heat transfer function enables a calculation of heat transfer
coefficient for laminar and turbulent flow regime. The geometry,
constant and fluid parameters of the function are the same as for
kc_laminar and kc_turbulent. The calculation conditions for laminar and
turbulent flow is equal to the calculation in kc_laminar and
kc_turbulent. A smooth transition between both functions is carried out
between 2200 ≤ Re ≤ 30000 (see figure below).

Verification

The mean Nusselt number Nu representing the mean convective heat
transfer coefficient kc is shown below for different numbers of turns
n_nt at constant total length of the helical pipe.

The convective heat transfer of a helical pipe is enhanced compared to a
straight pipe due to occurring turbulences resulting out of centrifugal
forces. The higher the number of turns, the better is the convective
heat transfer for the same length of a pipe.

Note that the ratio of hydraulic diameter to total length of helical
pipe d_hyd/L has no remarkable influence on the coefficient of heat
transfer kc.

=======================================================================================================

::

Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc of a
helical pipe for turbulent flow regime.

Functions kc_turbulent and kc_turbulent_KC

There are basically three differences:

-   The function kc_turbulent is using kc_turbulent_KC but offers
    additional output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt
    number and failure status (an output of 1 means that the function is
    not valid for the inputs).
-   Generally the function kc_turbulent_KC is numerically best used for
    the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc
    at known mass flow rate.
-   You can perform an inverse calculation from kc_turbulent_KC, where
    an unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean
    convective heat transfer coefficient kc

The critical Reynolds number Re_crit in a helical pipe depends on its
mean curvature diameter. The smaller the mean curvature diameter of the
helical pipe d_mean, the earlier the turbulent regime will start due to
vortexes out of higher centrifugal forces.

Geometry

Calculation

The mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for helical pipes is
calculated through the corresponding Nusselt number Nu according to [VDI
2002, p. Ga 2, eq. 6] :

    Nu = (zeta_TOT/8)*Re*Pr/{1 + 12.7*(zeta_TOT/8)^0.5*[Pr^(2/3)-1]},

where the influence of the pressure loss on the heat transfer
calculation is considered through

    zeta_TOT = 0.3164*Re^(-0.25) + 0.03*(d_hyd/d_coil)^(0.5) and

and the resulting mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc

    kc =  Nu * lambda / d_hyd
