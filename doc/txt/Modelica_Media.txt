Library of media property models

Information
===========

::

This library contains interface definitions for media and the following
property models for single and multiple substance fluids with one and
multiple phases:

-   Ideal gases:
        1241 high precision gas models based on the NASA Glenn
        coefficients,

    plus ideal gas mixture models based on the same data.
-   Water models:
        ConstantPropertyLiquidWater, WaterIF97 (high precision water
        model

    according to the IAPWS/IF97 standard)
-   Air models:
        SimpleAir, DryAirNasa, and MoistAir

-   Incompressible media:
        TableBased incompressible fluid models (properties are defined
        by

    tables rho(T), HeatCapacity_cp(T), etc.)
-   Compressible liquids:
        Simple liquid models with linear compressibility

The following parts are useful, when newly starting with this library:

-   Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.
-   Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumUsage describes how to use a medium
    model in a component model.
-   Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition describes how a new fluid
    medium model has to be implemented.
-   Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.ReleaseNotes summarizes the changes of the
    library releases.
-   Modelica.Media.Examples contains examples that demonstrate the usage
    of this library.
