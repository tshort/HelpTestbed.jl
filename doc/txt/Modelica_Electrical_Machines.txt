Library for electric machines

Information
===========

::

This package contains electric machine models and components for
modeling these machines.

Limitations and assumptions:

-   number of phases (of induction machines) is limited to 3, therefore
    definition as a constant m=3
-   phase symmetric windings as well as symmetry of the whole machine
    structure
-   all values are used in physical units, no scaling to p.u. is done
-   only basic harmonics (in space) are taken into account
-   waveform (with respect to time) of voltages and currents is not
    restricted
-   constant parameters, i.e., no saturation, no skin effect

You may have a look at a short summary of space phasor theory at
http://www.haumer.at/refimg/SpacePhasors.pdf

Further development:

-   generalizing space phasor theory to m phases with arbitrary spatial
    angle of the coils
-   generalizing space phasor theory to arbitrary number of windings and
    winding factor of the coils
-   MachineModels: other machine types
-   effects: saturation, skin-effect, ...
