The Modelica.Electrical.QuasiStationary library addresses the analysis
of electrical circuits with purely sinusoidal voltages and currents. The
main characteristics of the library are:

-   Only pure sinusoidal voltages and currents are taken into account.
    Higher harmonic voltages and currents are not considered.
-   Any electrical transient effects are negelcted.
-   The electrical components of this library are strictly linear.
-   The angular frequency omega of the voltages and currents of a
    circuit are determined from a reference angle gamma by means of
    omega = der(gamma).
-   The reference angle gamma is not a global quantity since it
    propagated through the connector. Therefore, independent circuits of
    different frequencies can be modeled in one model.
-   The connectors contain the real and the imaginary part of the
    voltage and the current RMS phasors

The main intention of this library is the modeling of quasi stationary
behavior of single and multi phase AC circuits with fixed and variable
frequency. Quasi stationary theory and applications can be found in
[Dorf1993], [Burton1994], [Landolt1936], [Philippow1967], [Weyh1967],
[Vaske1973].

Note
----

A general electrical circuit can be a DC circuit, an AC circuit with
periodic sinusoidal or non-sinusodial voltages and currents or a
transient circuit without particular waveform of voltages and currents.
Therefore a coupling model between a quasi stationary circuit and a
general (transient) electrical circuit has to be designed carefully
taking the specific application into account. As an exmaple, you may
look at the ideal AC DC converter, which is used in the rectifier
example.

The purely sinusoidal voltage

in the time domain can be represented by a complex rms phasor

For these quasi stationary phasor the following relationship applies:

This equation is also illustrated in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1: Relationship between voltage phasor and time domain voltage

From the above equation it is obvious that for t = 0 the time domain
voltage is v = cos(φv). The complex representation of the phasor
corresponds with this instance, too, since the phasor is leading the
real axis by the angle φv.

The explanation given for sinusoidal voltages can certainly also be
applied to sinusoidal currents.

A simple example of a series connection of a resistor, an inductor and a
capacitor as depicted in Fig. 1 should be explained in the following.
For various frequencies, the voltage drops across the resistor, the
inductor and the capacitor should be determined.

Fig. 1: Series AC circuit of a resistor and an inductor at variable
frequency

The voltage drop across the resistor

and the inductor

and the capacitor

add up to the total voltage

as illustrated in the phasor diagram of Fig. 2.

Fig. 2: Phasor diagram of a resistor and inductance series connection

Due to the series connection of the resistor, inductor and capacitor,
the three currents are all equal:

=======================================================================

::

For periodic waveforms, the average value of the instantaneous power is
real power P. Reactive power Q is a term associated with inductors and
capacitors. For pure inductors and capacitors, real power is equal to
zero. Yet, there is instantaneous power exchanged with connecting
network.

The series resonance circuit which was also adressed in the AC circuit
will be investigated.

Power of a resistor

The instantaneous voltage and current are in phase:

[image12]
    [image13]

Therefore, the instantaneous power is

A graphical representation of these equations is depicted in Fig. 1

Fig. 1: Instantaneous voltage, current of power of a resistor

Real power of the resistor is the average of instantaneous power:

Power of an inductor

The instantaneous voltage leads the current by a quarter of the period:

[image14]
    [image15]

Therefore, the instantaneous power is

A graphical representation of these equations is depicted in Fig. 2

Fig. 2: Instantaneous voltage, current of power of an inductor

Reqactive power of the inductor is:

Power of a capacitor

The instantaneous voltage lags the current by a quarter of the period:

[image16]
    [image17]

Therefore, the instantaneous power is

A graphical representation of these equations is depicted in Fig. 3

Fig. 3: Instantaneous voltage, current of power of a capacitor

Reqactive power of the capacitor is:

Complex apparent power

For an arbitrary component with two pins, real and reactive power can be
determined by the complex phasors:

In this equation \* represents the conjugate complex operator

The reference angle gamma:

-   defines the angular frequency omega of the voltages and currents of
    a circuit by means of omega = der(gamma).
-   is not a global quantity since it propagated through the connector.
    Therefore, independent circuits of different frequencies can be
    modeled in one model.
-   is present only once in a multiphase connector; a multiphase
    component has only one reference angle common to all phases.
-   can be either constant or variable, but it has to be consistent in
    one contiguous circuit.
-   is defined by the sources.

Designing new components, the guidelines of the Modelica Specification
dealing with Overconstrained Equation Operators for Connection Graphs
have to be taken into account.
