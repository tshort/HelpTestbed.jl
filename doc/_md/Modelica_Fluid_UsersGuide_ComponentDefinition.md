================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

::

In this section the design of the fluid connectors is explained.

Fluid connectors represent the points in a device (e.g., the flanges)
through which a fluid can flow into or out of the component, carrying
its thermodynamic properties; these flanges are assumed to be fixed in
space.

A major design goal is that components can be arbitrarily connected and
that the important balance equations are automatically fulfilled when 2
or more components are connected together at one point as shown in the
next figure:

In such a case the balance equations define **ideal mixing**, i.e., the
upstream discretization scheme of each component uses values that result
from ideal mixing in an infinitely small time period. If more realistic
modelling is desired that takes into account mixing losses, an explicit
model has to be used in the connection point.

### Single substance media

For a single substance medium, the connector definition in
Modelica.Fluid.Interfaces.FluidPort reduces to

    connector FluidPort
       replaceable package Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                "Medium model of the fluid";
       flow Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
                "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component";
       Medium.AbsolutePressure p
                "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
       stream Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
                 "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow < 0";
    end FluidPort;

The first statement defines the Medium flowing through the connector. In
a medium, medium specific types such as "Medium.AbsolutePressure" are
defined that contain medium specific values for the min, max and nominal
attributes. Furthermore, Medium.MassFlowRate is defined as:

    type MassFlowRate =
       Modelica.SIunits.MassFlowRate(quantity="MassFlowRate." + mediumName);

With the current library design, it is necessary to explictly select the
medium model for each component in a circuit. This model is then
propagated to the ports, and a Modelica translator will check that the
quantity and unit attributes of connected interfaces are identical.
Therefore, an error occurs, if connected FluidPorts do not have a medium
with the same medium name. In the future, automatic propagation of fluid
models through the ports will be introduced, but this still not possible
with Modelica 3.0.

The thermodynamic pressure is an *effort* variable, which means that the
connection of two or more ports states that the port pressures are the
same.

The mass flow rate is a *flow*variable, which means that the connection
of two or more ports states that the sum of all flow rates is zero.

The last variable is a *stream* variable, i.e., a specific quantity
carried by the flow variable. The quantity on the connector always
corresponds to the value close to the connection point, assuming that
the fluid is flowing out of the connector, regardless of the actual
direction of the flow. This helps avoiding singularities when the mass
flow goes through zero. The stream properties for the other flow
direction can be inquired with the built-in operator inStream(..), while
the value of the stream variable corresponding to the actual flow
direction can be inquired through the built-in operator
actualStream(..).

The actual equations corresponding to these operators are introduced and
solved automatically by the tool. In principle, they correspond to the
balance equation sum(flow\_variable) = 0 and
sum(flow\_variable\*stream\_variable\_at\_connection) = 0 applied to the
set of connected ports. In this case the first equation is the mass
balance sum(m\_flow) = 0, and the second is the energy balance at the
connection point sum(m\_flow\*h\_connection) = 0.

In the simpler case of a one-to-one connections between port\_a and
port\_b, inStream(port\_a.h\_outflow) just returns port\_b.h\_outflow.
For multiple-way connections, mixing equations are generated, and
special care is taken in order to avoid discontinuities around zero flow
rates. For more details, see this presentation which illustrates the
stream concept rationale and the underlying technicalities.

A connector should have only the minimal number of variables to describe
the interface, otherwise there will be connection restrictions in
certain cases. Therefore, in the connector no redundant variables are
present, e.g., the temperature T is not present because it can be
computed from the connector variables pressure p and specific enthalpy
h.

Here are two simple examples to illustrate modeling with stream
connectors. The first one is a rigid adiabatic volume mixing two flows,
where the kinetic and gravitational terms in the energy balance are
neglected for simplicity.

    model MixingVolume "Volume that mixes two flows"
      replaceable package Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
      FluidPort port_a, port_b;
      parameter Modelica.SIunits.Volume V "Volume of device";
      Modelica.SIunits.Mass             m "Mass in device";
      Modelica.SIunits.Energy           U "Inner energy in device";
      Medium.BaseProperties medium(preferredMediumStates=true) "Medium in the device";
    equation
      // Definition of port variables
      port_a.p         = medium.p;
      port_b.p         = medium.p;
      port_a.h_outflow = medium.h;  // The stream variable always corresponds to the
      port_b.h_outflow = medium.h;  // properties of the fluid holdup (outgoing flow)

      // Total quantities
      m = V*medium.d;
      U = m*medium.u;
       // Mass and energy balance (actualStream(..) is a built-in operator for streams to
      // compute the right h, depending on the flow direction)
      der(m) = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
      der(U) = port_a.m_flow*actualStream(port_a.h_outflow) +
               port_b.m_flow*actualStream(port_b.h_outflow);
    end MixingVolume;

The second example is the model of a component describing a lumped
pressure loss between two ports, with no energy storage and no heat
transfer. An isenthalpic transformation is assumed (changes in kinetic
and potential energy between inlet and outlet are neglected)

    model PressureLoss "Pressure loss component"
      replaceable package Medium=Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialPureSubstance;
      FluidPort port_a, port_b:
      Medium.ThermodynamicState port_a_state_inflow "State at port_a if inflowing";
      Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow "State at port_b if inflowing";
      Medium density d_a, d_b "Density at ports a and b if inflowing";
      replaceable function f "Function to compute the mass flow rate";
    equation
      // Medium states for inflowing fluid
      port_a_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_a.p, inStream(port_a.h_outflow));
      port_b_state_inflow = Medium.setState_phX(port_b.p, inStream(port_b.h_outflow));
      // Mass balance
      0 = port_a.m_flow + port_b.m_flow;
      // Instantaneous propagation of enthalpy flow between the ports with
      // isenthalpic state transformation (no storage and no loss of energy)
      port_a.h_outflow = inStream(port_b.h_outflow);
      port_b.h_outflow = inStream(port_a.h_outflow);
      // (Regularized) Momentum balance
      port_a.m_flow = f(port_a.p, port_b.p, d_a, d_b);
    end PressureLoss;

If many such components are connected in series between two models with
storage, the specific enthalpies are propagated in both directions and
available to all pressure loss components, without problems when the
mass flow goes through zero. The function f then uses either d\_a or
d\_b depending on the sign of port\_a.p-port\_b.p, with a suitable
regularization around zero to avoid discontinuities.

Please note that these models are highly idealized in order to explain
the stream connector concept. Device models in the library are much more
complete, handling issues such as initialization, steady vs. dynamic
modelling, heat transfer from the outside, etc.

### Multiple-substance media

Modelica.Fluid can handle models where the fluid contains multiple
substances, so that its composition can be characterized by mass
fraction vectors.

    connector FluidPort
       replaceable package Medium = Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
          "Medium model of the fluid";
       flow Medium.MassFlowRate m_flow;
          "Mass flow rate from the connection point into the component"
       Medium.AbsolutePressure p
          "Thermodynamic pressure in the connection point";
       stream Medium.SpecificEnthalpy h_outflow
           "Specific thermodynamic enthalpy close to the connection point if m_flow < 0";
       stream Medium.MassFraction Xi_outflow[Medium.nXi]
           "Independent mixture mass fractions m_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow < 0";
       stream Medium.ExtraProperty C_outflow[Medium.nC]
           "Properties c_i/m close to the connection point if m_flow < 0";
      end FluidPort;

The mass fraction vectors Xi and C are also stream quantities, as they
are carried by the mass flow rate. The corresponding connection
equations are sum(m\_flow\*Xi) and sum(m\_flow\*C), which correspond to
mass balances for the single substances. The vector Xi contains the mass
fractions of the main components of the fluid, and is used together with
p and h to determine the thermodynamic state of the fluid. The vector C
contains the mass fraction of the trace components, which are accounted
for in mass balances, but is ignored when computing the fluid
properties. This allows to easily declare and use medium models with
trace components starting from existing medium models (e.g., adding
CO~2~ traces to Moist Air for air conditioning models).

### Approximations in balance equations at connection point

Summing up, when two or more ports of the type FluidPort are connected,
the following equations are generated by the tool:

    sum(port_j.m_flow) = 0;               // Total Mass balance
    port_j = port_k;                      // Momentum balance
    sum(port_j.m_flow*h_connection) = 0;  // Energy balance
    sum(port_j.m_flow*Xi_connection) = 0; // Single component mass balances
    sum(port_j.m_flow*C_connection) = 0;  // Trace components mass balances

It is **very important** to bear in mind that

-   the mass balances are always exact;
-   the momentum and energy balance are only exact when two port with
    the same diameter are connected, because there is no friction and no
    change in fluid velocity.

In all other cases, i.e., different port diameters and/or multple port
connections:

-   The momentum balance does not consider friction effects and changes
    of pressure due to changes in velocity.
-   There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the order of
    magnitude of the dynamic pressure Ïv^2^/2.
-   The energy balance does not consider the kinetic terms (gravity
    terms cancel out due to the infinitesimal size of the connection
    volume). There might thus be errors in the momentum balance of the
    order of magnitude of the kinetic energy v\^2/2.

In many applications, where fluid speeds are low and thermal phenomena
are mainly of interest, these approximations are commonly made and lead
to acceptable results. In all other cases, explicit fitting and junction
models should be used, that model explicitly all the kinetic phenomena
with the appropriate level of detail.

For one-dimensional flow along the coordinate "x", the following partial
differential equations hold

Mass balance

Momentum balance

Energy balance 1

Pipe friction

x: independent spatial coordinate (flow is along coordinate x)
  ~ t: time v(x,t): mean velocity p(x,t): mean pressure T(x,t): mean
    temperature Ï(x,t): mean density u(x,t): specific internal energy
    z(x): height over ground A(x): area perpendicular to direction x g:
    gravity constant f: Fanning friction factor S: circumference

An alternative energy balance can be derived by multiplying the momentum
balance with "v" and substracting it from the energy balance 1 above.
This results in the "energy balance 2":

  --------------------- --------------
  Energy balance 2      ![image16](../
                        Resources/Imag
                        es/Fluid/Users
                        Guide/energyBa
                        lance2.png)
  --------------------- --------------

This formulation separates the internal energy of the fluid from the
kinetic energy of fluid flow. The internal energy is treated by the
energy balance 2, the kinetic energy is treated by the momentum balance
equally well. The evaluation of medium properties, which are independent
of the kinetic energy, and the formulation of many fluid models is
simplified with the energy balance 2. The overall conservation of energy
is achieved by considering the mutual dependencies of energy and
momentum balance.

Some components in the library, like DynamicPipe, provide a rigorous
implementation of mass, momentum and energy balance, using the energy
balance 2 equation. Other components, like Valves and Fittings, neglect
the impact of changes of the kinetic energy and potential energy on the
energy balance, because they are usually irrelevant compared to changes
due to heat flows. The StaticPipe component neglects the effect of
kinetic energy, but includes the potential energy in the balance, which
might be substantial.

All modelling assumptions and simplifications are stated in the
component documentation; please note that some of the assumptions might
be stated in the base classes the component inherits from.

=======================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

::

When implementing a Fluid component, the difficult arises that the value
of intensive quantities (such as p, T, Ï) shall be accessed from the
**upstream** volume. For example, if the fluid flows from volume A to
volume B, then the intensive quantities of volume B have no influence on
the fluid between the two volumes. On the other hand, if the flow
direction is reversed, the intensive quantities of volume A have no
influence on the fluid between the two volumes.

In the Modelica.Fluid library, such a situation is handeled with the
following code fragment (from Interfaces.PartialTwoPortTransport):

    replaceable package Medium =
                   Modelica.Media.Interfaces.PartialMedium
                   annotation(choicesAllMatching = true);

    Medium.ThermodynamicState port_b_state_inflow
                    "Medium state close to port_b for inflowing mass flow";

The medium states for inflowing media can be used to compute density and
dynamic viscosity which in turn can be use to formulate the pressure
drop equation. The standard pressure drop equation

    dp = port_a - port_b;
    m_flow = sqrt(2/(zeta*diameter))*if dp >= 0 then  sqrt(dp)
                                                else -sqrt(-dp)

cannot be used, since the function has an infinite derivative at dp=0.
Instead the region around zero mass flow rate must be regularized using
one of the regularization functions of Modelica.Fluid.Utilities. This
requires to have density and/or other medium properties for both flow
directions at the same time. These media properties can be computed from
the medium states of the inflowing fluid at the two ports.

If the above component is connected between two volumes, i.e., the
independent medium variables in port\_a and port\_b are usually states,
then port\_a.h and port\_b.h are either states (i.e., known quantities
in the model) or are computed from states. In either case they are
"known". In such a situation, all equations can be directly evaluated
without any problems. Zero or reversed mass flow rate does not pose any
problems because the medium properties are always computed for both flow
directions and are then used in the regularization function.

If 3 or more components are connected together, it can be shown that a
system of non-linear algebraic equations appear. The equations are
written by purpose in such a form, that a tool can select mass flow
rates and pressures as iteration variables of this system. The advantage
is that these iteration variables are continuous and even often
differentiable. The alternative to use the medium states as iteration
variables is not good, because T,h,d are discontinuous for reversing
flow direction.

============================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

::

Pressure drop equations and other fluid characteristics are usually
computed by **semi-empirical** equations. Unfortunately, the developers
of semi-empirical equations nearly never take into account that the
equation might be used in a simulation program. As a consequence, these
semi-empirical equations can nearly never be used blindly but must be
slightly modified or adapted in order that obvious simulation problems
are avoided. Below, examples are given to demonstrate what problems
occur and how to regularize the characteristics:

### Square root function

In several empirical formulae, expressions of the following form are
present, e.g., for turbulent flow in a pipe:

    y = if x < 0 then -sqrt( abs(x) ) else sqrt(x)

A plot of this characteristic is shown in the next figure:

The difficulty with this function is that the derivative at x=0 is
infinity. In reality, such a function does not exist. E.g., for pipe
flow, the flow becomes laminar for small velocities and therefore around
zero the sqrt() function is replaced by a linear function. Since the
laminar region is usually of not much practical interest, the above
approximation is used.

The direct implementation above does not work in Modelica, because an
event is generated when x < 0 changes sign. In order to detect this
event, an event iteration takes place. During the event iteration, the
active if-branch is not changed. For example, assume that x is positive
(= "else" branch) and shall become negative. During the event iteration
x is slightly negative and the else branch, i.e., sqrt(x), is evaluated.
Since this results in an imaginary number, an error occurs. It would be
possible to fix this, by using the **noEvent**() operator to explicitly
switch of an event:

    y = if noEvent(x < 0) then -sqrt( abs(x) ) else sqrt(x)

Still, it is highly likely that good integrators will not work well
around x=0, because they will recognize that the derivative changes very
sharply and will reduce the step size drastically.

There are several solutions around this problem: Around x=0, the sqrt()
function can be replaced by a polynomial of 3rd order which is
determined in such a way that it smoothly touches the sqrt() function,
i.e., the whole function is continuous and continuously differentiable.
In the Modelica.Fluid library, implementations of such critical
functions are provided in sublibrary Modelica.Fluid.Utilities. The above
sqrt() type function is computed by function **Utilities.regRoot**().
This function is defined as:

    y := x/(x*x+delta*delta)^0.25;

where "delta" is the size of the small region around zero where the
sqrt() function is approximated by another function. The plot of the
function above is practically identical to the one of the original
function. However, it has a finite derivative at x=0 and is
differentiable upto any order. With the default value of delta=0.01, the
difference between the function above and regRoot(x) is 16% around
x=0.01, 0.25% around x=0.1 and 0.0025% around x=1.

::

One important special case for a pressure loss is the friction at the
wall of a pipe under the assumption of quasi steady state flow (i.e.,
the mass flow rate varies only slowly). In this section it is explained
how this case is handeled in the Modelica.Fluid library for pipes with
**nonuniform roughness**, including the smooth pipe as a special case
(see
[Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction](Modelica_Fluid_Pipes_BaseClasses_WallFriction.html#Modelica.Fluid.Pipes.BaseClasses.WallFriction).
The treatment is non-standard in order to get a numerically well-posed
description.

For pipes with circular cross section the pressure drop is computed as:

    dp = Î»(Re,D)*(L/D)*Ï*v*|v|/2
       = Î»(Re,D)*8*L/(Ï^2*D^5*Ï)*m_flow*|m_flow|
       = Î»2(Re,D)*k2*sign(m_flow);

> with
>   ~ Re = |v|*D*Ï/Î¼
>       ~ = |m\_flow|*4/(Ï*D\*Î¼)
>
>     m\_flow = A*v*Ï A = Ï*(D/2)\^2 Î»2 = Î»*Re\^2 k2 =
>     L*Î¼\^2/(2*D\^3\*Ï)
>
where

-   L is the length of the pipe.
-   D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a circular cross
    section, D = 4\*A/P, where A is the cross section area and P is the
    wetted perimeter.
-   Î» = Î»(Re,D) is the "usual" wall friction coefficient.
-   Î»2 = Î»\*Re\^2 is the used friction coefficient to get a numerically
    well-posed formulation.
-   Re = |v|\*D\*Ï/Î¼ is the Reynolds number.
-   D = d/D is the relative roughness where "d" is the absolute
    "roughness", i.e., the averaged height of asperities in the pipe (d
    may change over time due to growth of surface asperities during
    service, see *[Idelchick 1994, p. 85, Tables 2-1, 2-2])*.
-   Ï is the upstream density.
-   Î¼ is the upstream dynamic viscosity.
-   v is the mean velocity.

The first form with Î» is used and presented in textbooks, see "blue"
curve in the next figure:

This form is not suited for a simulation program since Î» = 64/Re if Re <
2000, i.e., a division by zero occurs for zero mass flow rate because Re
= 0 in this case. More useful for a simulation model is the friction
coefficient Î»2 = Î»\*Re\^2, because Î»2 = 64\*Re if Re < 2000 and
therefore no problems for zero mass flow rate occur. The characteristic
of Î»2 is shown in the next figure and is used in Modelica.Fluid:

The pressure loss characteristic is divided into three regions:

-   **Region 1**: For **Re â¤ 2000**, the flow is **laminar** and the
    exact solution of the 3-dim. Navier-Stokes equations (momentum and
    mass balance) is used under the assumptions of steady flow, constant
    pressure gradient and constant density and viscosity (=
    Hagen-Poiseuille flow) leading to Î»2 = 64\*Re. Therefore:

        dp = 128*Î¼*L/(Ï*D^4*Ï)*m_flow 

-   **Region 3**: For **Re â¥ 4000**, the flow is **turbulent**.
    Depending on the calculation direction (see "inverse formulation"
    below) either of two explicite equations are used. If the pressure
    drop dp is assumed to be known, Î»2 = |dp|/k2. The Colebrook-White
    equation *[Colebrook 1939; Idelchik 1994, p. 83, eq. (2-9)]*:

        1/sqrt(Î») = -2*lg( 2.51/(Re*sqrt(Î»)) + 0.27*D) 

    gives an implicit relationship between Re and Î». Inserting Î»2 =
    Î»\*Re\^2 allows to solve this equation analytically for Re:

        Re = -2*sqrt(Î»2)*lg(2.51/sqrt(Î»2) + 0.27*D)

    Finally, the mass flow rate m\_flow is computed from Re via m\_flow
    = Re\*Ï\*D\*Î¼/4\*sign(dp). These are the **red** curves in the
    diagrams above. If the mass flow rate is assumed known (and
    therefore implicitly also the Reynolds number), then Î»2 is computed
    by an approximation of the inverse of the Colebrook-White equation
    *[Swamee and Jain 1976; Miller 1990, p. 191, eq.(8.4)]* adapted to
    Î»2:

        Î»2 = 0.25*(Re/lg(D/3.7 + 5.74/Re^0.9))^2 

    The pressure drop is then computed as dp = k2\*Î»2\*sign(m\_flow).
    These are the **blue** curves in the diagrams above.

-   **Region 2**: For **2000 â¤ Re â¤ 4000** there is a transition region
    between laminar and turbulent flow. The value of Î»2 depends on more
    factors as just the Reynolds number and the relative roughness,
    therefore only crude approximations are possible in this area. The
    deviation from the laminar region depends on the relative roughness.
    A laminar flow at Re=2000 is only reached for smooth pipes. The
    deviation Reynolds number Re1 is computed according to *[Samoilenko
    1968; Idelchik 1994, p. 81, sect. 2.1.21]* as:

        Re1 = 745*e^(if D â¤ 0.0065 then 1 else 0.0065/D)

    These are the **blue** curves in the diagrams above.
      ~ Between Re1=Re1(d/D) and Re2=4000, Î»2 is approximated by a cubic

    polynomial in the "lg(Î»2) - lg(Re)" chart (see figures above) such
    that the first derivative is continuous at these two points. In
    order to avoid the solution of non-linear equations, two different
    cubic polynomials are used for the direct and the inverse
    formulation. This leads to some discrepancies in Î»2 (= differences
    between the red and the blue curves). This is acceptable, because
    the transition region is anyway not precisely known since the actual
    friction coefficient depends on additional factors and since the
    operating points are usually not in this region.

The absolute roughness d has usually to be estimated. In *[Idelchik
1994, pp. 105-109, Table 2-5; Miller 1990, p. 190, Table 8-1]* many
examples are given. As a short summary:

  -------------------------- --------------------------------- ------------

The equations above are valid for incompressible flow. They can also be
applied for **compressible** flow up to about **Ma = 0.6** (Ma is the
Mach number) with a maximum error in Î» of about 3 %. The effect of gas
compressibility in a wide region can be taken into account by the
following formula derived by Voronin *[Voronin 1959; Idelchick 1994, p.
97, sect. 2.1.81]*:

    Î»_comp = Î»*(1 + (Îº-1)/2 * Ma^2)^(-0.47)

where Îº is the isentropic coefficient (for ideal gases, Îº is the ratio
of specific heat capacities cp/cv). An appreciable decrease in the
coefficent "Î»\_comp" is observed only in a narrow transonic region and
also at supersonic flow velocities by about 15% *[Idelchick 1994, p. 97,
sect. 2.1.81]*. This effect is not yet included in Modelica.Fluid.
Another restriction is that the pressure drop model is valid only for
steady state or slowly changing mass flow rate. For large fluid
acceleration, the pressure drop depends additionally on the frequency of
the changing mass flow rate.

### Inverse formulation

In the "Advanced menu" it is possible via parameter "from\_dp" to define
in which form the pressure drop equation is actually evaluated
(**default** is from\_dp = **true**):

    from_dp = true:   m_flow = f1(dp)
            = false:  dp     = f2(m_flow)

"from\_dp" can be useful to avoid nonlinear systems of equations in
cases where the inverse pressure loss function is needed.

### Summary

A detailed pressure drop model for pipe wall friction is provided in the
form m\_flow = f1(dp, D) or dp = f2(m\_flow, D). These functions are
continuous and differentiable, are provided in an explicit form without
solving non-linear equations, and do behave well also at small mass flow
rates. This pressure drop model can be used stand-alone in a static
momentum balance and in a dynamic momentum balance as the friction
pressure drop term. It is valid for incompressible and compressible flow
up to a Mach number of 0.6.

=====================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

::

The control valves in
[Modelica.Fluid.Valves](Modelica_Fluid_Valves.html#Modelica.Fluid.Valves)
have the parameters **Kv** and **Cv**. They are defined as unit-less
variables, but in the description text a unit is given. The reason for
this definition is the following:

The basic equation for valves is:

    q = Av*sqrt(dp/rho)

In SI units, [q] is m3/s, [dp] is Pascal, [rho] is [kg/m3], and Av is an
area, thus [Av] = m2. Basically, the equation stems from Bernoulli's
law. Av is roughly 1.4 times the area of the valve throat. Now, usually
valves aren't so big that their throat area is of the order of magnitude
of square meters - depending on the applications it is from a few square
millimeters to a few square centimeters. Therefore, in the common
engineering practice, the following equations are used:

Europe:

    q = Kv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = m3/h, [dp] = bar

US:

    q = Cv sqrt(dp/(rho/rho0)) , with [q] = USG/min, [dp] = psi

In both cases rho0 is the density of cold water at 4 Â°C, 999 kg/m3. Note
that these equations use relative, not absolute densities.

It turns out that Kv = 1e6/27.7\*Av and Cv = 1e6/24\*Av, so both US and
EU engineers get more or less the same numbers (just by sheer luck),
with a range between a few units and a few hundred units for typical
industrial applications, and everybody is happy.

Now, we've got two problems here. First, depending on the unit, we
change the equation: with SI units, we use the density, with non-SI
units, we use the relative density. So the quantities (not only the
units!) of Av and Cv/Kv are different.

Second, the units of Kv and Cv are usually labelled "m3/h" and
"USG/min", but as a matter of fact they are different, as can be seen
from the equations above: they are actually m3/(h\*sqrt(bar)) and
USG/(min\*sqrt(psi)). If I have a valve with Kv = 10 m3/h, it means I
get 10 m3/h "for a pressure drop of 1 bar". Unfortunately, this is not
correct from the point of view of strict dimensional analysis, but
nobody uses sqrt(Pa) or sqrt(bar).

You might think this is crazy (it is, expecially when you try to explain
it), but as a matter of fact the valve coefficient is **never** given in
square meters in any catalog or datasheet; Cv is still the most used
(even in Europe), followed by Kv. So, it will be very inconvenient for
users to type in Av in square meters.

The pragmatic approach used in Modelica.Fluid.ControlValves is to accept
the fact that m3/h and USG/min are not the real units of Cv and Kv, so
we can't use the general unit conversion mechanism, put them just as
mnemonic labels in the comment, use non-dimensional coefficients in the
interface, and then define properly dimensioned unit conversion within
the model
