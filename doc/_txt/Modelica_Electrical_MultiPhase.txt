Modelica.Electrical.MultiPhase: Modelica.Electrical.MultiPhase



Library for electrical components with 2, 3 or more phases

Information
===========

::

This package contains packages for electrical multiphase components,
based on Modelica.Electrical.Analog:

-   Basic: basic components (resistor, capacitor, inductor, ...)
-   Ideal: ideal elements (switches, diode, transformer, ...)
-   Sensors: sensors to measure potentials, voltages, and currents
-   Sources: time-dependend and controlled voltage and current sources

This package is intended to be used the same way as
Modelica.Electrical.Analog but to make design of multiphase models
easier. The package is based on the plug: a composite connector
containing m pins. It is possible to connect plugs to plugs or single
pins of a plug to single pins. Potentials may be accessed as
plug.pin[].v, currents may be accessed as plug.pin[].i.

Further development:

-   temperature-dependent resistor
-   lines (m-phase models)
