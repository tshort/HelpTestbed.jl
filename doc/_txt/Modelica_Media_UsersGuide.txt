::

Library Modelica.Media is a free Modelica package providing a
standardized interface to fluid media models and specific media models
based on this interface. A fluid medium model defines algebraic
equations for the intensive thermodynamic variables used in the mass and
energy balance of component models. Optionally, additional medium
properties can be computed such as dynamic viscosity or thermal
conductivity. Medium models are defined for single and multiple
substance fluids with one and multiple phases.

A large part of the library provides specific medium models that can be
directly utilized. This library can be used in all types of Modelica
fluid libraries that may have different connectors and design
philosophies. It is particularily utilized in the Modelica_Fluid library
(the Modelica_Fluid library is currently under development to provide 1D
thermo-fluid flow components for single and multiple substance flow with
one and multiple phases). The Modelica.Media library has the following
main features:

-   Balance equations and media model equations are decoupled. This
    means that the used medium model does usually not have an influence
    on how the balance equations are formulated. For example, the same
    balance equations are used for media that use pressure and
    temperature, or pressure and specific enthalpy as independent
    variables, as well as for incompressible and compressible media
    models. A Modelica tool will have enough information to generate as
    efficient code as a traditional (coupled) definition. This feature
    is described in more detail in section Static State Selection.
-   Optional variables, such as dynamic viscosity, are only computed if
    needed in the corresponding component.
-   The independent variables of a medium model do not influence the
    definition of a fluid connector port. Especially, the media models
    are implemented in such a way that a connector may have the minimum
    number of independent medium variables in a connector and still get
    the same efficiency as if all medium variables are passed by the
    connector from one component to the next one (the latter approach
    has the restriction that a fluid port can only connect two
    components and not more). Note, the Modelica_Fluid library uses the
    first approach, i.e., having a set of independent medium variables
    in a connector.
-   The medium models are implemented with regards to efficient dynamic
    simulation. For example, two phase medium models trigger state
    events at phase boundaries (because the medium variables are not
    differentiable at this point).

This User's Guide has the following main parts:

-   Medium usage describes how to use a medium model from this library
    in a component model.
-   Medium definition describes how a new fluid medium model has to be
    implemented.
-   ReleaseNotes summarizes the changes of the library releases.
-   Future provides information about the upcoming version 3.1 of
    Modelica.Media and some changes to this version to enable forward
    compatibility.
-   Contact provides information about the authors of the library as
    well as acknowledgements.

[image11] Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.ReleaseNotes
================================================

::

Version included in Modelica 3.0

See top-level release notes for MSL.

Version 1.0, 2005-03-01

Many improvements in the library, e.g., providing mixtures of the ideal
gases, table based media, test suite for all media, improved and updated
User's Guide.

Version 0.9, 2004-10-18

-   Changed the redeclaration/extends within packages from the
    experimental feature to the language keywords introduced in Modelica
    2.1.
-   Re-introduced package "Water.SaltWater" in order to test substance
    mixtures (this medium model does not describe real mixing of water
    and salt).
-   Started to improve the documentation in
    Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.MediumDefinition.BasicStructure

Version 0.792, 2003-10-28

This is the first version made available for the public for the
Modelica'2003 conference (for evaluation).

[image12] Modelica.Media.UsersGuide.Future
==========================================

::

Planned changes for version 3.1

Several changes are planned for version 3.1 of Modelica.Media. In order
to have an easy transition, the current verison is moved to the
ObsoleteModelica-package and current users can continue to use ot for
many years. The goal for the new version is to cover many more fluids,
be easier to use for users and less for implementors that want to
include their own models. A beta-version of the new media libray will be
available in the first quarter of 2009.

The main user-visible changes are:

-   No distinction between pure fluids and mixtures on the interface
    level: pure fluids are mixtures with 1 component
-   Compressibility will in the future be a flag that can be set for
    those media where it makes sense. It will thus be possible to treat
    an ideal gas as incompressible, which is adequate for certain
    applications, and also use the same medium model for thermal-only
    applications, and thermal-hydraulic ones.
-   All functions will have derivatives to enable analytic Jacobians.
-   Mole-fraction based media for process applications

For further information on the upcoming version, please contact the
Author

Forward compatibility

In order to simplify transition to the upcoming version of
Modelica.Media for Modelica 3.1, a new enumeration has been introduced:
IndependentVariables with the entries ph, pT, pTX, phX and dTX. Users
are advised to use this enumeration to determine the independent
variables of a medium. If they are going to use the function based
interface of the current Modelica.Media (and not use the BaseProperties
from Modelica.Media), they should not have any trouble using the next
version without any need for changes in their code.

Acknowledgements:

The development of this library has been a collaborative effort and many
have contributed:

-   The essential parts of the media models have been implemented in the
    ThermoFluid library by Hubertus Tummescheit with help from Jonas
    Eborn and Falko Jens Wagner. These media models have been converted
    to the Modelica.Media interface definition and have been improved by
    Hubertus Tummescheit.
-   The effort for the development of the Modelica.Media library has
    been organized by Martin Otter who also contributed to the design,
    implemented part of the generic models, contributed to the User's
    Guide and provided the generic test suite
    Modelica.Media.Examples.Tests.
-   The basic idea for the medium model interface based on packages is
    from Michael Tiller who also contributed to the design.
-   The first design of the medium model interface is from Hilding
    Elmqvist. The design and the implementation has been further
    improved at the Modelica design meetings in Dearborn, Nov. 20-22,
    2002 Dearborn, Sept. 2-4, 2003 Lund Jan. 28-30, 2004 Munich, May
    26-28, 2004 Lund, Aug. 30-31, 2004 Dearborn, Nov. 15-17, 2004
    Cremona Jan. 31 - Feb. 2, 2005.
-   Hans Olsson, Sven Erik Mattsson and Hilding Elmqvist developed
    symbolic transformation algorithms and implemented them in Dymola to
    improve the efficiency considerably (e.g., to avoid non-linear
    systems of equations).
-   Katrin Pröß implemented the moist air model
-   Rüdiger Franke performed the first realistic tests of the
    Modelica.Media and Modelica_Fluid libraries and gave valuable
    feedback.
-   Francesco Casella has been the most relentless bug-hunter and tester
    of the water and ideal gas properties. He also contributed to the
    User's Guide.
-   John Batteh, Daniel Bouskela, Jonas Eborn, Andreas Idebrant, Charles
    Newman, Gerhart Schmitz, and the users of the ThermoFluid library
    provided many useful comments and feedback.
