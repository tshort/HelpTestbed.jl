This library contains components for modelling of electromagnetic
fundamental wave models for the application in three phase electric
machines. DC machines are (currently) not included in this library. The
FundamentalWave library is an alternative approach to the
Modelica.Electrical.Machines library. A great advantage of this library
is the strict object orientation of the electrical and magnetic
components that the electric machines models are composed of. From a
didactic point of view this library is very beneficial for students in
the field of electrical engineering.

For more details see the concept.

Overview of the concept of fundamental waves

The exact magnetic field in the air gap of an electric machine is
usually determined by an electro magnetic finite element analysis. The
waveform of the magnetic field, e.g., the magnetic potential difference
[image10], consists of a spatial fundamental wave - with respect to one
pole pair - and additional harmonic waves of different order. The
fundamental wave is however dominant in the air gap of an electric
machine.

Field lines of a four pole induction machine

In the fundamental wave theory only a pure sinusoidal distribution of
magnetic quantities is assumed. It is thus assumed that all other
harmonic wave effects are not taken into account.

Magnetic potential difference of a four pole machine, where [image11] is
the angle of the spatial domain with respect to one pole pair

The waveforms of the magnetic field quantities, e.g., the magnetic
potential difference [image12], can be represented by complex phasor,
e.g., [image13] according to:

Spatial distribution of the magnetic potential difference (red shade =
positive sine wave, blue shade = negative sine wave) including complex
phasor representing this spatial distribution

The potential and flow quantities of this library are the complex
magnetic potential difference and the complex magnetic flux as defined
in the basic magnetic port. Due to the sinusoidal distribution of
magnetic potential and flux, such a complex phasor representation can be
used. This way, the FundamentalWave library can be seen as a spatial
extension of the FluxTubes library.

The specific arrangement of windings in electric machines with [image14]
pole pairs give rise to sinusoidal dominant magnetic potential wave. The
spatial period of this wave is determined by one pole pair [Mueller70,
Spaeth73].

The main components of an electric machine model based on the
FundamentalWave library are multi phase and single phase windings, air
gap as well as symmetric or salient cage models. The electric machine
models provided in this library are based on symmetrical three phase
windings in the stator and equivalent two or three phase windings in the
rotor.

Assumptions

The machine models of the FundamentalWave library are currently based on
the following assumptions

-   The number of stator phases is limited to three [Eckhardt82]
-   The phase windings are assumed to be symmetrical; an extension to
    this approach can be considererd
-   Only fundamental wave effects are taken into account
-   There are no restrictions on the waveforms of voltages and currents
-   All resistances and inductances are modeled as constant quantities;
    saturation effects, cross coupling effects [Li07], temperature
    dependency of resistances and deep bar effects could be considered
    in an extension to this library
-   Core losses, i.e., eddy current and hysteresis losses, friction
    losses and stray load losses are currently not considered [Haumer09]
-   The only dissipated losses in the electric machine models are
    currently ohmic heat losses

Note

The term fundamental wave refers to spatial waves of the electro
magnetic quantities. This library has no limitations with respect to the
waveforms of the time domain signals of any voltages, currents, etc.
