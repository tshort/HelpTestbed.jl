===============================================================================================

::

Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for a
laminar fluid flow over an even surface.

Functions kc_laminar and kc_laminar_KC

There are basically three differences:

-   The function kc_laminar is using kc_laminar_KC but offers additional
    output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt number and
    failure status (an output of 1 means that the function is not valid
    for the inputs).
-   Generally the function kc_laminar_KC is numerically best used for
    the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc
    at known mass flow rate.
-   You can perform an inverse calculation from kc_laminar_KC, where an
    unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean convective
    heat transfer coefficient kc

Restriction

-   laminar regime (Reynolds number ≤ 1e5)
-   Prandtl number 0.6 ≤ Pr ≤ 2000

Geometry

Calculation

The mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for flat plate is
calculated through the corresponding Nusselt number Nu_lam according to
[VDI 2002, p. Gd 1, eq. 1] :

    Nu_lam = 0.664 * Re^(0.5) * (Pr)^(1/3)

and the corresponding mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc:

    kc =  Nu_lam * lambda / L

with

  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------
  cp                     as specific heat capacity at constant pressure
                         [J/(kg.K)],

  eta                    as dynamic viscosity of fluid [Pa.s],

  kc                     as mean convective heat transfer coefficient
                         [W/(m2.K)],

  lambda                 as heat conductivity of fluid [W/(m.K)],

  L                      as length of plate [m],

  Nu_lam                 as mean Nusselt number for laminar regime [-],

  Pr = eta*cp/lambda     as Prandtl number [-],

  rho                    as fluid density [kg/m3],

  Re = rho*v*L/eta       as Reynolds number [-].
  ---------------------- -------------------------------------------------

Verification

The mean Nusselt number Nu in the laminar regime representing the mean
convective heat transfer coefficient kc for Prandtl numbers of different
fluids is shown in the figure below.

Note that this function is best used in the laminar regime up to a
Reynolds number Re smaller than 2300. There is a deviation w.r.t.
literature due to the neglect of the turbulence influence in the
transition regime even though this function is used inside its cited
restrictions for a higher Reynolds number. The function kc_overall is
recommended for the simulation of a Reynolds number higher than 2300.

[image8] Modelica.Fluid.Dissipation.Utilities.SharedDocumentation.HeatTransfer.Plate.kc_overall
===============================================================================================

::

Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for a
laminar or turbulent fluid flow over an even surface.

Functions kc_overall and kc_overall_KC

There are basically three differences:

-   The function kc_overall is using kc_overall_KC but offers additional
    output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt number and
    failure status (an output of 1 means that the function is not valid
    for the inputs).
-   Generally the function kc_overall_KC is numerically best used for
    the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc
    at known mass flow rate.
-   You can perform an inverse calculation from kc_overall_KC, where an
    unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean convective
    heat transfer coefficient kc

Restriction

-   constant wall temperature
-   overall regime (Reynolds number 1e1 < Re < 1e7)
-   Prandtl number 0.6 ≤ Pr ≤ 2000

Geometry and Calculation

This heat transfer function enables a calculation of heat transfer
coefficient for laminar and turbulent flow regime. The geometry,
constant and fluid parameters of the function are the same as for
kc_laminar and kc_turbulent.

The calculation conditions for laminar and turbulent flow is equal to
the calculation in kc_laminar and kc_turbulent. A smooth transition
between both functions is carried out between 1e5 ≤ Re ≤ 5e5 (see figure
below).

Verification

The mean Nusselt number Nu = sqrt(Nu_lam^2 + Nu_turb^2) representing the
mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for Prandtl numbers of
different fluids is shown in the figure below.

=================================================================================================

::

Calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for a
hydrodynamically developed turbulent fluid flow over an even surface.

Functions kc_turbulent and kc_turbulent_KC

There are basically three differences:

-   The function kc_turbulent is using kc_turbulent_KC but offers
    additional output variables like e.g. Reynolds number or Nusselt
    number and failure status (an output of 1 means that the function is
    not valid for the inputs).
-   Generally the function kc_turbulent_KC is numerically best used for
    the calculation of the mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc
    at known mass flow rate.
-   You can perform an inverse calculation from kc_turbulent_KC, where
    an unknown mass flow rate is calculated out of a given mean
    convective heat transfer coefficient kc

Restriction

-   turbulent regime (Reynolds number 5e5 < Re < 1e7)
-   Prandtl number 0.6 ≤ Pr ≤ 2000

Geometry

Calculation

The mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc for flat plate is
calculated through the corresponding Nusselt number Nu_turb according to
[VDI 2002, p. Gd 1, eq. 2]:

    Nu_turb = (0.037 * Re^0.8 * Pr) / (1 + 2.443/Re^0.1 * (Pr^(2/3)-1))

and the corresponding mean convective heat transfer coefficient kc:

    kc =  Nu_turb * lambda / L

fluids is shown in the figure below.
