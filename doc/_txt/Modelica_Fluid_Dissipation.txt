Modelica.Fluid.Dissipation: Modelica.Fluid.Dissipation



Functions for convective heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics

Information
===========

::

Library description
-------------------

This library contains convective heat transfer and pressure loss
functions written in Modelica®. Generally the pressure loss calculations
are based on incompressible fluids and total pressure difference. For
devices with non changing cross sectional area, the calculated total
pressure loss is equal to the static pressure difference. Geodetic
pressure loss is not considered throughout the library. The functions
supplied may be used separately. The library is a non-commercial product
of XRG Simulation GmbH. It makes use of external, non-commercial models
supplied by Modelica Standard Library. In order to work correctly,
ensure that this library is always loaded with Modelica Standard Library
version 3.1 especially to be able to use Modelica.Fluid applications.

The development of the Fluid.Dissipation library is founded within the
ITEA research project EuroSysLib-D by German Federal Ministry of
