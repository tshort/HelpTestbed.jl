Incompressible media package
----------------------------

This package provides a structure and examples of how to create simple
medium models of incompressible fluids, meaning fluids with very little
pressure influence on density. The medium properties is typically
described in terms of tables, functions or polynomial coefficients.

Definitions
-----------

The common meaning of incompressible is that properties like density and
enthalpy are independent of pressure. Thus properties are conveniently
described as functions of temperature, e.g., as polynomials density(T)
and cp(T). However, enthalpy can not be independent of pressure since h
= u - p/d. For liquids it is anyway common to neglect this dependence
since for constant density the neglected term is (p -p0)/d, which in
comparison with cp is very small for most liquids. For water, the
equivalent change of temperature to increasing pressure 1 bar is 0.025
Kelvin.

Two boolean flags are used to choose how enthalpy and inner energy is
calculated:

-   enthalpyOfT=true, means assuming that enthalpy is only a function of
    temperature, neglecting the pressure dependent term.
-   singleState=true, means also neglect the pressure influence on inner
    energy, which makes all medium properties pure functions of
    temperature.

The default setting for both these flags is true, which enables the
simulation tool to choose temperature as the only medium state and
avoids non-linear equation systems, see the section about Static state
selection in the Modelica.Media User's Guide.

Contents
--------

Currently, the package contains the following parts:

1.  Table based medium models
2.  Example medium models

A few examples are given in the Examples package. The model
Examples.Glycol47 shows how the medium models can be used. For more
realistic examples of how to implement volume models with medium
properties look in the Medium usage section of the User's Guide.
