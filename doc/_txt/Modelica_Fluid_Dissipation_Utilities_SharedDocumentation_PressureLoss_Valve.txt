::

Calculation of pressure loss for a valve with different geometries at
overall flow regime for incompressible and single-phase fluid flow in
dependence of its opening.

Restriction

This function shall be used inside of the restricted limits according to
the referenced literature.

-   developed fluid flow
-   ball valve
-   diaphragm valve
-   butterfly valve
-   gate valve
-   sluice valve

Geometry

Wide variations in valve geometry are possible and a manufacturer will
not necessarily maintain geometric similarity between valves of the same
type but of different size. Here pressure loss can be estimated for the
following types of a valve:

-   ball valve
-   diaphragm valve
-   butterfly valve
-   gate valve
-   sluice valve

Calculation

The mass flow rate m_flow for valves out of pressure loss is determined
by:

    m_flow = [rho * dp * Av^2 / (zeta_TOT/2]^0.5
    m_flow = (2/zeta_TOT)^0.5 * Av * (rho * dp)^0.5
    m_flow = valveCharacteristic * Av * (rho * dp)^0.5

with

  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------
  rho                   as density of fluid [kg/m3],

  Av                    as (metric) flow coefficient (cross sectional
                        area) [m^2],

  m_flow                as mass flow rate [kg/s],

  valveCharacteristic   as coefficient of a valve in dependence of its
                        opening [-],

  velocity              as mean velocity [m/s],

  zeta_TOT              as pressure loss coefficient [-].
  --------------------- --------------------------------------------------

The valveCharacteristic is determined out of a correlation for the
pressure loss coefficient (zeta_TOT) in dependence of its opening. The
reason for introducing an additional variable valveCharacteristic is a
different definition of the following pressure loss correlations of
valves.

Verification

The pressure loss coefficient (zeta_TOT) of a valve with different
geometries are shown in dependence of the opening in the figure below.

Note that the pressure loss coefficients (zeta_TOT) are numerically
optimised for very small openings (opening â‰¤ 5%). At openings smaller
than 5% the pressure loss coefficient is smoothly set to a maximum value
(zeta_TOT_max) to be adjusted as parameter. Therefore a very small
leakage mass flow rate can be adjusted for a given pressure difference
at almost closed valves. A very small leakage mass flow rate can often
be neglected in system simulation with valves, whereas the numerical
behaviour of the simulation is improved.

The mass flow rate of different valves at a constant opening of 50% in
dependence of pressure loss is shown in the figure below.
