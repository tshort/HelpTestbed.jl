Modelica.Electrical.Analog: Modelica.Electrical.Analog



Library for analog electrical models

Information
===========

::

This package contains packages for analog electrical components:

-   Basic: basic components (resistor, capacitor, conductor, inductor,
    transformer, gyrator)
-   Semiconductors: semiconductor devices (diode, bipolar and MOS
    transistors)
-   Lines: transmission lines (lossy and lossless)
-   Ideal: ideal elements (switches, diode, transformer, idle, short,
    ...)
-   Sources: time-dependend and controlled voltage and current sources
-   Sensors: sensors to measure potential, voltage, and current
