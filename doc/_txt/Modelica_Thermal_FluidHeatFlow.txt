Modelica.Thermal.FluidHeatFlow: Modelica.Thermal.FluidHeatFlow



Simple components for 1-dimensional incompressible thermo-fluid flow
models

Information
===========

::

This package contains very simple-to-use components to model coolant
flows as needed to simulate cooling e.g., of electric machines:

-   Components: components like different types of pipe models
-   Examples: some test examples
-   Interfaces: definition of connectors and partial models (containing
    the core thermodynamic equations)
-   Media: definition of media properties
-   Sensors: various sensors for pressure, temperature, volume and
    enthalpy flow
-   Sources: various flow sources

Variables used in connectors:

-   Pressure p
-   flow MassFlowRate m_flow
-   SpecificEnthalpy h
-   flow EnthalpyFlowRate H_flow

EnthalpyFlowRate means the Enthalpy = cpconstant * m * T that is carried
by the medium's flow. Limitations and assumptions:

-   Splitting and mixing of coolant flows (media with the same cp) is
    possible.
-   Reversing the direction of flow is possible.
-   The medium is considered to be incompressible.
-   No mixtures of media is taken into consideration.
-   The medium may not change its phase.
-   Medium properties are kept constant.
-   Pressure changes are only due to pressure drop and geodetic height
    differnence rho*g*h (if h > 0).
-   A user-defined part (0..1) of the friction losses (V_flow*dp) are
    fed to the medium.
-   Note: Connected flowPorts have the same temperature (mixing
    temperature)! Since mixing may occur, the outlet temperature may be
    different from the connector's temperature. Outlet temperature is
    defined by variable T of the corresponding component.

Further development:

-   Additional components like tanks (if needed)
